Contributing

Small, resume-focused repo â€” use this file to remind reviewers how to run the project and what to change.

Before publishing

- Ensure `dataset.csv` is in the project root or update the scripts to point to your data path.
- Double-check `README.md` for typos and that the Quick start commands work on your machine.
- Remove any sensitive data or large files from the repo (use Git LFS for large datasets if needed).

How to contribute

- Fork the repository, create a feature branch, and open a pull request.
- Keep changes small and focused; include tests for data-processing changes when possible.
